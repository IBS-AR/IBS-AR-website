## E.A. (Alf) Cornish award

The E.A. (Alf) Cornish award was established in 2011 at the regional conference in Kiama, New South Wales, Australia. It is for recognition of a member in the Australasian Region who has given ‘longtime’ service to the Biometric Society and to the advancement of biometry.
