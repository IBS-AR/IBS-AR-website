## Our members

In 2023 there are approximately 175 members of the Australasian Region. Almost three-quarters of our members reside in Australia, with more than half of these from the states of Queensland and New South Wales. The other quarter of our members are mostly from New Zealand, although we also have members that reside in England, Italy, USA, China, Germany and Vietnam.

## How to join

We welcome as members biologists, mathematicians, statisticians, and others interested in applying similar techniques. Individuals usually join as regular members, but we also offer free student membership. See this document for more information for new (and other) members. We also expect all members to abide by the regional by-laws and code of conduct.

The two membership categories (regular and student) are explained on the membership types page. All members of the society receive electronic access to the journals Biometrics and the Journal of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics (JABES), as well as the newsletter Biometric Bulletin. Student membership is free but only regular members have voting privileges and can hold office.

As of 2021, we now have an online membership portal where you can apply to join the society and renew membership online. If you would like to join the society, then please click the button below.
