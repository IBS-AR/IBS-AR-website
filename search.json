Individuals usually join as regular members, but we also offer free student membership. See this document for more information for new (and other) members. We also expect all members to abide by the regional by-laws and code of conduct.\nThe two membership categories (regular and student) are explained on the membership types page. All members of the society receive electronic access to the journals Biometrics and the Journal of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics (JABES), as well as the newsletter Biometric Bulletin. Student membership is free but only regular members have voting privileges and can hold office.\nAs of 2021, we now have an online membership portal where you can apply to join the society and renew membership online. If you would like to join the society, then please click the button below.\n\n Join The Society"

    "text": "Definition of Biometrics\nThe terms “Biometrics” and “Biometry” have been used since early in the 20th century to refer to the field of development of statistical and mathematical methods applicable to data analysis problems in the biological sciences.\nStatistical methods for the analysis of data from agricultural field experiments to compare the yields of different varieties of wheat, for the analysis of data from human clinical trials evaluating the relative effectiveness of competing therapies for disease, or for the analysis of data from environmental studies on the effects of air or water pollution on the appearance of human disease in a region or country are all examples of problems that would fall under the umbrella of “Biometrics” as the term has been historically used.\nThe journal “Biometrics” is a scholarly publication sponsored by a non-profit professional society (the International Biometric Society) devoted to the dissemination of accounts of the development of such methods and their application in real scientific contexts.\nRecently, the term “Biometrics” has also been used to refer to the emerging field of technology devoted to identification of individuals using biological traits, such as those based on retinal or iris scanning, fingerprints, or face recognition. Neither the journal “Biometrics” nor the International Biometric Society is engaged in research, marketing, or reporting related to this technology. Likewise, the editors and staff of the journal are not knowledgeable in this area."
