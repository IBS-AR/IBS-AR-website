The direct link is biometricsboi.nz.\nThe dates are 27 November to 1 December 2023, to be held at the Copthorne Hotel and Resort Bay of Islands, Waitangi, NZ. As was intended for 2021, the 2023 conference aims to be a joint event with Statistical Ecology and Environmental Monitoring (SEEM) conference. Conference themes for 2023 are:\nStatistical Genetics/’Omics Spatial/Temporal Modelling Design/Surveys Biostatistics Agricultural Statistics Demographic/Population Modelling Multivariate Statistics Statistical Consulting—Best Practice & Collaboration Data Governance/Sovereignty Machine Learning for Environmental and Ecological Applications A biennial meeting is one of the main activities of the region, which enables members and non-members to come together to exchange ideas, learn about new research methodologies and applications, network and establish important contacts and collaboration opportunities. These five-day conferences are renowned for being intimate regarding numbers of participants, yet large enough to facilitate worthwhile invited and contributed talks as well as poster presentations. The program typically has a reception gathering, a poster event, an excursion afternoon and an evening conference dinner, all to encourage social and professional networking. Specialist pre-conference short-courses on the first day are also a feature for those interested or wanting professional development.\nYou can read more about conferences here."

    "text": "Definition of Biometrics\nThe terms “Biometrics” and “Biometry” have been used since early in the 20th century to refer to the field of development of statistical and mathematical methods applicable to data analysis problems in the biological sciences.\nStatistical methods for the analysis of data from agricultural field experiments to compare the yields of different varieties of wheat, for the analysis of data from human clinical trials evaluating the relative effectiveness of competing therapies for disease, or for the analysis of data from environmental studies on the effects of air or water pollution on the appearance of human disease in a region or country are all examples of problems that would fall under the umbrella of “Biometrics” as the term has been historically used.\nThe journal “Biometrics” is a scholarly publication sponsored by a non-profit professional society (the International Biometric Society) devoted to the dissemination of accounts of the development of such methods and their application in real scientific contexts.\nRecently, the term “Biometrics” has also been used to refer to the emerging field of technology devoted to identification of individuals using biological traits, such as those based on retinal or iris scanning, fingerprints, or face recognition. Neither the journal “Biometrics” nor the International Biometric Society is engaged in research, marketing, or reporting related to this technology. Likewise, the editors and staff of the journal are not knowledgeable in this area."
